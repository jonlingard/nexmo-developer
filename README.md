# Nexmo Developer

Nexmo Developer is a platform hosting the Nexmo documentation, API reference, SDKs, Tools & Community content.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.4.1 + bundler
- PostgreSQL
- Yarn

### Setup

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Nexmo/nexmo-developer.git
$ cd nexmo-developer
$ cp .env.example .env
$ bundle install
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ ./bin/yarn install
$ foreman start
```

### Setting up with Docker

If you don't want to install Ruby & PostgreSQL then you can use docker to sandbox Nexmo Developer into its own containers. After you [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) run the following:

```
# Start the web server
$ docker-compose up

# Setup the Database (you only need to do this once)
$ docker-compose run web rake db:setup

# Open the browser
$ open http://localhost:3000
```

You will still need to run the webpack-dev-server on your local machine.

To stop the server cleanly run:

```
$ docker-compose down
```

### Compiling assets

To compile assets in runtime simply start the webpack server with:

```
$ ./bin/webpack-dev-server
```

You can run both the Rails server and Webpack simultaneously using Foreman:

```
$ foreman start
```

### Features

- A powerful markup engine with pipeline (see [this blog post](https://lab.io/articles/2017/02/12/extending-markdown-with-middleware/) for details on how this works).
- Automatically generated navigation based on the contents of `_documentation`.
- Turbolinks for progressively loading content into for a seamless user experience.

### Future Features

- Dynamic content for community section
- Interactive examples of the Nexmo APIs

## Pulling in code from other repos

Some examples require code from repos such as [nexmo-community/nexmo-ruby-quickstart](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-ruby-quickstart) these repos can be defined in `config/repos.yml` as such:

```
nexmo-community/nexmo-ruby-quickstart: 'master'
```

The code can then be pulled into the `.repo` directory with the following command:

```
$ rake repos:pull
```

To pull a single repo provide the GitHub repo name and optional branch:

```
$ rake repos:pull nexmo-community/nexmo-ruby-quickstart master
```

## Troubleshooting

#### I'm getting an error `A server is already running.  Check /myapp/tmp/pids/server.pid.` when I run `docker-compose up`.

This is because Docker wasn't shut down cleanly. To fix this run:

```
$ docker-compose run web rm /myapp/tmp/pids/server.pid
```

#### A webpack error occurs during setup

Run the `webpack-dev-server` like so:

```
$ ./bin/webpack-dev-server
```
