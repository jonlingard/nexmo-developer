## Introducing Nexmo Developer

Nexmo Developer is the new home for our documentation, API references, community content and resources. Our team has been working hard to improve our developer experience whether you're new to Nexmo APIs or a well accustomed with our platform and tooling.

We will continue to iterate and improve on Nexmo Developer and provide new and innovative ways for you to help you implement Nexmo's APIs into your products quickly, confidently and easily.

### A bit of history

Having great tooling is incredibly important for being agile, iterative and innovative. Prior to Nexmo Developer the documentation for Nexmo APIs was at <https://docs.nexmo.com>, a site that has served its purpose well over the last four years.

As we looked to evolve our documentation beyond just guides our statically generated documentation site didn't seem like the best option for moving forward with. We needed something that accelerate us, have the power to be dynamic but retain the simplicity that we've come to love from file based static site generators.

### Our Goals

In January 2017 we started planning out an information architecture that would make content in Nexmo Developer easy and intuitive to find and to provide consistent content across our products. We created a collection of values that would provide a clear direction for us going forward:

| ### Simple
|
| The NDP should serve as the clearest example of what our products are and how to implement them. Documentation and examples should contain no more than the minimum amount of information the developer needs to understand to implement the product, further information should be signposted and hosted elsewhere within the documentation or externally where appropriate.

| ### Developer centric
|
| The NDP should be built with the developer in mind. The site should be designed to be clear, concise, technical and to the point. Furthermore effort should be focused on what is really important for the developer and the context and environment that the documentation will be consumed. For example, inaccuracies or ambiguities should be resolved ahead of superficial changes to the mobile styling.

| ### Easy to navigate and Consistent
|
| The information architecture of NDP should be designed to allow developers to find the most appropriate information as easily as possible.
|
| By enforcing a clear and consistent structure throughout the documentation content will become easier to find and quickly retrievable at a later date.
|
| A style guide will be created outlining the structure in more detail, the requirements for guides and the tone of voice for the NDP copy.

| ### Accessible
|
| Accessibility is about catering for developers with different spoken languages and programming language preferences but most importantly is to enable developers of a varying range of technical expertise. The NDP information architecture should be driven by this providing documentation appropriate for all developers.

| ### Shareable
|
| We need to ensure that documentation can be referenced from support platforms. You should be able to hover over each heading, subheading or example to create an anchored permalink.
|
| This allows us to stay in control of our content by ensuring documentation is always shared by reference as opposed to copying and pasting.

| ### Beautiful
|
| Beauty is an important tool in conveying the craftsmanship of our product and therefore gaining trust and buy-in. It can also be used as a mechanism for enhancing more in-depth topics to increase engagement.

| ### Canonical and Versioned
|
| Currently documentation exists at <https://docs.nexmo.com>
|
| It is important to not break a resource that a developer is using and that we maintain support for all URLs that the current docs are using and update the pages with clear notices of where to find the latest documentation that relates to the content of that page.
|
| Significant future changes should also be versioned especially a product or service is deprecated or changes significantly.

We've made great progress to moving towards these values and will continue to iterate and improve on our platform.

### What we've done so far

We've got a lot planned for the future of our content but given our breadth of products it was important to take what we had already and make it much more accessible, readable and discoverable.

Alongside the guides that we transitioned we created new overview pages for all of our products making it easy to understand their capabilities, to help developers to find the information they needed as easily as possible. We also introduced 'building blocks' as a quick reference to common practical implementations, we hope you'll find these as useful resources during discovery and development phases.

We moved API references into its own section and by adding a side navigation it's easier than ever to find content you need and to keep track of where you are when you are context shifting between Nexmo Developer and your codebase.

Lastly we've created new community section with support for vides and the events you'll find our team attending, sponsoring and speaking at. We're excited to grow this to be hub of community driven content in the future.

From a technical standpoint we made Nexmo Developer simpler to contribute to by providing [contributing guidelines](/contribute), making our platform more predicable and by simplifying much of the Markdown source documents.

### How

Nexmo Developer has been built as an open-source platform built using a mix of Ruby on Rails, HTML, JavaScript (ES7 + Webpack), Sass and a custom Markdown parser. All of the tooling and documentation is available for you to contribute to or remix for your own project.

The documentation content is file based making it easy for anybody to contribute even within GitHub's own code editor with Markdown support. Alternatively you can clone Nexmo Developer locally and run it in your own development environment, we even have Docker support to make setup easy and self contained.

### What next?

In the short term we'll be **reviewing our content** and improving our code examples to be more consistent and to always use our [Libraries](/tools). We'll shortly be **adding search support** helping you find content more quickly across Nexmo Developer and our [Knowlegebase](https://help.nexmo.com).

In the future we'll be looking to **revise our API Reference** and have it powered by [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) to be more consistent, easier to read and thorough. We've also got a lot of ideas about  **personalising documentation examples** and **adding interactivity to our tooling** where appropriate to enrich our learning resources.

### Conclusion

We've come a long way but we've got much to to do and improve. We hope that the steps we've made will have a positive impact on you and your teams productivity when integrating with Nexmo.

As always we welcome feedback and as if you could use the feedback. If youâ€™ve got something, positive or negative, to tell us, please tell us using the feedback tool at the bottom of each guide or [file an issue](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-developer/issues/new) on GitHub.
